Saumya:

What did I do yesterday: Creating endpoints to retrieve and send data to MySQL
What was in my way: Keep getting a 403 unauthorized error when I try to retrieve data from the backend, not sure why this is happening
What will I do today: looking into fixing the endpoints and investigating the issue further. I will also work on the existing stories and will meet with the team for a work session
