Saumya:

What did I do yesterday: Managed to sort out most of the API issues and thought about adding some new features to the UI based on our latest ideas.
What was in my way: Still facing a few small bugs with the API integration that need to be ironed out, regarding entering food and putting calories and macros automatically.
What will I do today: I'll think about how a user should use the app and their actions at each step.

Athena: 

What did I do yesterday: helped finding external APIs for calories and macros that we need for food function. Updated the UI to make it more user-friendly
What was in my way: Encountered some challenges with database that took longer to fix than expected
What will I do today: I'll twork on the best design for entering calories and macros with least amount of friction and make it coherent with adding fitness goals function.

Doruk:

What did I do yesterday: tried to fix the server issues we were having and connected with SQL
What was in my way: I had to learn about pulling data from database and showing it in the applicable format in the frontend.
What will I do today: I'll work on displaying foods to enter in a nice format and recoding them to our mysql db.
